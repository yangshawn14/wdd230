                Visual hierarchy is the principle of arranging elements to show their order of importance. In
                the Yugioh website, they demonstrate this by displaying a large image of their new booster pack
                they are currently marketing. This shows what they want their audience to see first and be interested
                in purchasing.

                Instagram's use of the double tap function to like photos is an example of Hick's Law.
                This allows users to quickly like a photo and then immediately continue scrolling down
                their newsfeed. In this way, users are either scrolling, reading, or liking photos and 
                videos.

            <h3>Repetition</h3>

                The principle of repetition helps with making a brand or statement have importance. An
                example of this can be seen in Donald Trump's official website. There is a repetition
                of Trump's name to emphasize to visiors of the page that he is the focus of the website.
